/*:
## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 88;
print("You have \(friends) friends on social media");
//:  Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
//friends -= 34

//:  Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
print("Because the number of friends on social media is declared as a constant rather than a variable, you can't change it because constants remain constant and don't varry");
