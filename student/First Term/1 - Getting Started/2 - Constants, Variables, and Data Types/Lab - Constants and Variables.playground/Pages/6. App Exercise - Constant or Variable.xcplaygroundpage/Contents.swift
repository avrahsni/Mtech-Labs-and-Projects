## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
var name = "John Smith";
print("If he wanted, he could legally change his name");
var age = 45;
print("Every year his age increases");
var steps = 4374;
print("His steps increase with every step");
let stepGoal = 13000;
print("His goal should remain constant, although I would see an application allowing the user to change their daily goal");
var averageHeartRate = 94;
print("His average heart rate isn't going to be the same every day, although it might be similar");

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
